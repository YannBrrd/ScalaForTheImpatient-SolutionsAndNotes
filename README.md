Thanks for dropping by.  First off, I can guarantee that `Scala for the Impatient` is one of the best programming language books I've ever read - it starts with a gentle introduction, gives adequate examples and has brilliant exercises. Even Martin Odersky acknowledges it himself in his Coursera lectures. 

I have tried to solve the problems myself and for places where I found myself incapable or felt the answers insufficient, I referred the [dirkraft/ScalaImpatient-AnswersAndNotes](https://github.com/dirkraft/ScalaImpatient-AnswersAndNotes) - so, if some answers are the same as from dirkraft, it is by no means coincidental. I should definitely thank the author for compiling all the exercise answers religiously.  

This repo also has the `notes` folder which has markdowns for each chapter.  They are more or less verbatim extracts and examples from the book itself which I generally use for revising. As it stands now, I can't assure you that it is very helpful to everybody else.
